2. Music: Search and play music using YouTube links, manage music queues, and download audio.
3. Chat interactions: Simple chat commands like rock-paper-scissors and coin flipping.
4. AI chat: Under development, a feature that allows users to interact with the bot.

## Files and Classes

1. `bonka_chain.py`: Contains the `BonkaApp` class, which handles the custom BonkaCoin currency system.
2. `music.py`: Contains the `MusicQueue` class for managing music queues, and several functions for searching, downloading, and playing music.

## Cogs

1. `BonkaCoin`: Implements the BonkaCoin currency system with commands like `newwallet`, `balance`, `pay`, `mint`, `destroy`, `forbes`, and `economy`.
2. `AI`: Currently under development, a cog for interacting with the bot using the `talk` command.
3. `Music`: (Not included in the provided code, but related functions are present in the `music.py` file)

## Setup

1. Install the required libraries: `discord.py`, `mysql.connector`, and `pytube`.
2. Set up the MySQL database using the provided schema in the `BonkaApp` and `MusicQueue` classes.
